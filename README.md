# catechism-in-json

This repository houses the __Catechism of the Catholic Church__, __The Canon Law__, and
__General Instruction of The Roman Missal__ all in usable JSON format. This repo utilises pickles from the
very well-known Catholic reddit bot [/u/Catebot](https://www.reddit.com/user/Catebot/) to create the JSONs. Please refer
the [Catebot GitHub repo](https://github.com/konohitowa/catebot) for more information.

The JSON files will be released in the releases section shortly.
