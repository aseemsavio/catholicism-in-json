# catechism-in-json

This repository houses the following resources, all in usable JSON format.

1. __Catechism of the Catholic Church__
2. __The Canon Law__
3. __General Instruction of The Roman Missal__

This repo utilises pickles from the
very well-known Catholic Reddit bot [/u/Catebot](https://www.reddit.com/user/Catebot/) to create the JSONs. Please refer
the [Catebot's GitHub repo](https://github.com/konohitowa/catebot) for more information.

The JSON files will be released in the releases section shortly.
